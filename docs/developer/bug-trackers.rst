Bug Trackers
============

The Zope developer community uses the `GitHub zopefoundation organization
<https://github.com/zopefoundation>`_ to host all projects. Each repository has
its own issue tracker for bug reports, feature requests or questions.


Zope developers track bugs within Zope using the ``Zope`` project on GitHub:

 https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues

To work on bugs in the ``Zope`` project, you need to sign the Plone Foundation
contributor agreement. :doc:`becoming-a-committer` explains how to do that.
