Reporting Bugs
==============

The Zope developer community uses the `GitHub zopefoundation organization
<https://github.com/zopefoundation>`_ to host all projects. Each repository
has its own issue tracker for bug reports, feature requests or questions.
For example, Zope developers track bugs within Zope using the ``Zope``
project on GitHub:

 https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues


How to write a good bug report
------------------------------

Here's how you get help most effectively:

- Before filing a bug report, make sure you can reproduce the issue on a plain
  vanilla Zope installation. If you cannot, then it's probably not a Zope bug.

- Please provide as many details as possible, such as...

  - Zope version
  - Python version
  - Operating system
  - Full Python tracebacks if you have them

- It's helpful to describe bugs in terms of expected and actual outcomes, that
  makes it easier to follow along and reproduce it: *In the Zope ZMI I was
  clicking on the Interfaces tab of a DTML Method, and instead of seeing the
  Interfaces tab I saw the following error output: ...*

- If the developers need more information and follow up with questions, please
  make sure to answer in a timely manner, especially if the issue report is
  marked with the feedback required tag. If we don't hear from you after 2-3
  weeks the issue may be closed.
