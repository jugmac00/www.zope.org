The Foundation
==============

The Zope Foundation
-------------------
The Zope Foundation had the goal to promote, maintain, and develop the
Zope platform, which it did successfully for many years. It is merging with
the Plone Foundation and passed its responsibilities to the Plone Foundation
in 2018.

The Plone Foundation
--------------------
Our community includes the open source community of contributors to
the Zope software, contributors to the documentation and web
infrastructure, as well as the community of businesses and
organizations that use Zope.

The Plone Foundation is the copyright holder of the Zope software and many
extensions and associated software maintained in the `zopefoundation` GitHub organization at https://www.github.com/zopefoundation.

The Plone Foundation also manages the zope.org website as well as supporting
infrastructure for open source collaboration.
