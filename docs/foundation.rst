The Plone Foundation
====================

The Zope Foundation had the goal to promote, maintain, and develop the
Zope platform, which it did successfully for many years. It passed its
responsibilities to the Plone foundation in 2018.


Our community includes the open source community of contributors to
the Zope software, contributors to the documentation and web
infrastructure, as well as the community of businesses and
organizations that use Zope. The Plone Foundation is the copyright
holder of the Zope software and many extensions and associated
software. The Plone Foundation also manages the zope.org website, and
manages the infrastructure for open source collaboration.
