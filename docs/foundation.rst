The Zope Foundation
===================

The Zope Foundation has the goal to promote, maintain, and develop the
Zope platform. It does this by supporting the Zope community.

Our community includes the open source community of contributors to
the Zope software, contributors to the documentation and web
infrastructure, as well as the community of businesses and
organizations that use Zope. The Zope Foundation is the copyright
holder of the Zope software and many extensions and associated
software. The Zope Foundation also manages the zope.org website, and
manages the infrastructure for open source collaboration.
